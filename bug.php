This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with PHP's type juggling and comparison operators.  The variable `$value` is intended to represent an integer, but due to the loose comparison (`==`), it results in unexpected behavior when compared to a string.

```php
<?php
$value = "10";

if ($value == 10) {
    echo "Value is equal to 10";
} else {
    echo "Value is not equal to 10";
}
?>
```

The output will be: "Value is equal to 10".  This is because PHP's loose comparison operator converts the string "10" to an integer for the comparison, leading to a seemingly correct result even though the type is different. This can cause subtle and hard-to-debug errors.
